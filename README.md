This repo contains lots of work in progress code for my
[Factor](http://factorcode.org/) projects.

Some useful(?) Factor related wiki pages I've written:

 * [Parsing Gmane with Factor](https://github.com/bjourne/playground-factor/wiki/Parsing-gmane-with-factor): a Factor tutorial
 * [Tips & Tricks](https://github.com/bjourne/playground-factor/wiki/Tips-and-tricks): Factor idioms and small recipes
 * [gc notes](https://github.com/bjourne/playground-factor/wiki/gc-notes): Random notes about Factors garbage collection system
 * [Bootstrapping Explained](https://github.com/bjourne/playground-factor/wiki/Bootstrapping-Explained): WIP walkthrough of the bootstrap process
